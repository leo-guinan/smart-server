# Free Discovery Call Offer üéØ

## üéØ The Hook

**"Your code is making money, but it's probably bleeding cash you don't even know about."**

### The Problem We're Solving:
- Vibecoders are making $1K-50K/month with "working" code
- But they're paying 2-5x more for hosting than they should
- Security holes they don't know about
- Performance bottlenecks costing them customers
- Platform lock-in preventing them from scaling

### The Solution:
**Free 15-minute discovery call** where we analyze their repo live and show them:
1. **Hidden costs** they're paying
2. **Security vulnerabilities** they don't know about
3. **Performance issues** losing them money
4. **Migration savings** they could get

## üõ† Technical Analysis Framework

### Automated Security Scan:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# security_scan.sh - Run during discovery call

echo "üîç Running security analysis..."

# Check for common vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level moderate
pip check
bundle audit

# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Check for outdated dependencies
npm outdated
pip list --outdated

# Check for security headers
curl -I https://their-domain.com | grep -i "x-frame-options\|x-content-type-options"

echo "‚úÖ Security analysis complete"
```

### Performance Analysis:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# performance_scan.sh

echo "‚ö° Running performance analysis..."

# Check page load times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://their-domain.com

# Check for large images
find . -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.png" | xargs ls -lh | awk '$5 > 100000'

# Check for unminified assets
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr | head -10

# Check database queries
grep -r "SELECT.*FROM" . | wc -l

echo "‚úÖ Performance analysis complete"
```

### Cost Analysis:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cost_analysis.sh

echo "üí∞ Running cost analysis..."

# Calculate current hosting costs
CURRENT_COST=$(curl -s "https://api.vercel.com/v1/accounts/me" | jq '.billing.usage')

# Calculate Smart Server costs
SMART_SERVER_COST=3.50  # Hetzner CX11

# Calculate savings
SAVINGS=$(echo "$CURRENT_COST - $SMART_SERVER_COST" | bc)

echo "Current monthly cost: \$$CURRENT_COST"
echo "Smart Server cost: \$$SMART_SERVER_COST"
echo "Potential monthly savings: \$$SAVINGS"
echo "Annual savings: \$$(echo "$SAVINGS * 12" | bc)"
