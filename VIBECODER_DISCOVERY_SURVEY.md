## ðŸ’° Revenue Projections

### Based on Survey Results:

#### **If 50% interested in discovery calls:**
- **50 calls** in month 1
- **30% conversion** to paid migration
- **15 migrations** Ã— $1,500 average = $22,500
- **Monthly recurring** = $1,500

#### **If 70% interested in discovery calls:**
- **70 calls** in month 1
- **40% conversion** to paid migration
- **28 migrations** Ã— $1,800 average = $50,400
- **Monthly recurring** = $2,800

#### **If 30% interested in discovery calls:**
- **30 calls** in month 1
- **20% conversion** to paid migration
- **6 migrations** Ã— $1,200 average = $7,200
- **Monthly recurring** = $600
