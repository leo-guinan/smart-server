## ⚠️ Critical: Before First Deploy

### Must Do
1. **Update `deploy/hetzner-cloud-init.yaml`**
   - Line 21: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/smart_server`
   - With your actual GitHub repo URL
   - Example: `yourusername/smart-server`

### Should Do
2. **Push code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial smart server"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/smart-server.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/validate.sh
   bash scripts/test-local.sh  # optional
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Status

### ✅ Tested
- Script validation (all scripts pass)
- JSON validation (meta.json valid)
- File permissions (all executables correct)
- Local structure (all required files present)

### ⏳ Not Yet Tested
- Full Hetzner deployment (cloud-init)
- Production experiment runs
- Phone-home integration
- Dashboard under load
- Multi-day operation

### 🔬 Needs Testing
1. Deploy to Hetzner test server
2. Run first real experiment
3. Verify dashboard updates
4. Check logs after 24 hours
5. Test manual experiment runs
6. Verify security (sudoers, firewall)

## 📝 Known Issues

### Blocking
- None

### Non-Blocking
1. **Date format portability**
   - `date -Iseconds` might not work on all systems
   - Solution: Use `date -Is` or portable format
   - Impact: Low (Linux deployment works)

2. **No log rotation**
   - Logs will grow indefinitely
   - Solution: Add logrotate config
   - Impact: Medium (disk space)

3. **No retry logic in phone-home**
   - Single attempt, fails silently
   - Solution: Add exponential backoff
   - Impact: Low (optional feature)

4. **Dashboard doesn't show loading state**
   - Blank until first experiment
   - Solution: Add skeleton UI
   - Impact: Low (UX only)

### Future Improvements
- See `TODO.md` for full list
