## 🎯 Value Demonstration Script

### Opening (2 minutes):
```
"Hi [Name], thanks for booking this call. I'm [Your Name], and I help vibecoders who are making money but paying too much for hosting.

Before we dive in, tell me:
1. What's your monthly revenue from this app?
2. What are you currently spending on hosting?
3. What's your biggest maintenance headache?

Great! Now let me show you what I found in your codebase..."
```

"Let me run a quick analysis of your repo...

🔍 Security Scan:
- Found [X] outdated dependencies
- [X] potential security vulnerabilities
- [X] hardcoded secrets (if any)
- [X] missing security headers

⚡ Performance Analysis:
- Page load time: [X] seconds (should be <2)
- Found [X] unoptimized images
- [X] database queries that could be optimized
- [X] unminified assets

💰 Cost Analysis:
- You're currently paying: $[X]/month
- Smart Server would cost: $3.50/month
- You're overpaying by: $[X]/month
- Annual savings: $[X]

🚨 Critical Issues:
- [List specific security/performance issues]
- [Explain business impact]
- [Show potential savings]

3. **Cost Waste**: You're paying $[X]/month for features you don't need
4. **Scaling Problem**: As you grow, costs will increase exponentially

If I migrated this to a Smart Server, you'd:
- Save $[X]/month immediately
- Get better performance
- Have full control
- Pay predictable costs
- Get 24/7 monitoring"
```

### Close (3 minutes):
